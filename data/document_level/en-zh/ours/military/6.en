What will be the result if China and India go to war again? From the
 comparison of weaponry of the three armies, does India have any chance
 of winning? Recently, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs passed out the latest
 news, “Chinese and Indian troops have been disengaged in four areas
 along the border, and the situation is generally controllable. ” At the
 same time, India's foreign minister Su Jiesheng also said publicly: 75%
 of the matters related to the disengagement of the Sino-Indian border
 have been resolved. This is a signal that the Sino-Indian border issue
 is developing for the better, but another issue is also quietly
 breeding - the increasing militarization of the Sino-Indian border. The
 existence of this problem increases the possibility of another war
 between China and India, and if China and India break out into war
 again, what will be the result? I. Weapons and Equipment Performance
 
 In 1962, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) easily took down the
 Indians, using only 32 days to end the dozens of strongholds they had
 operated for years along the Chinese border, and also inflicting heavy
 damage on the elite Indian army. Since that time, India has been holding
 its breath to avenge its shame. But until today, the Indian army only
 dared to small-scale harassment, and did not make a large-scale invasion
 as in 1962 and 1967. India has time and again declared that it “has the strength to confront
 China”, but can an ant shake a big tree? If India and China were to go
 to war again, it would be clear who would win and who would lose. According to the Global Firepower 2024 ranking, China is currently
 ranked third in the world in terms of military power, and India is
 fourth in the world. The ranking is based on more than 60 indicators
 such as conventional military power, total troop strength, military
 spending and logistical capabilities, and does not include nuclear
 weapons. Based on the information released by the government, we can briefly
 analyze the current weaponry of the Chinese army. For the army, the PLA's main equipment is the 5. 8mm 191 series
 (including standard automatic assault rifles, short assault rifles, and
 precision sniper rifles) and the 95-1 assault rifle. 191 precision
 rifles can be said to be a combination of many advantages, and on the
 basis of ordinary rifles, they have been improved, with the replacement
 of the heavy, high-precision barrels, and the increase in the optical
 sights, so that they have more advantages than ordinary rifles over long
 distances. long range with higher accuracy than ordinary rifles. At the same time, the rifle takes into account the need for mechanized
 combat in modern wars and adopts a retractable stock or foldable stock. With the addition of matching polymer transparent magazines, which can
 be seen inside when viewed under the sunlight, soldiers can know the
 amount of remaining ammunition according to the scale and numbers, so as
 to adjust the mode of combat. In addition, the magazines of the 191
 series firearms are universal, for example, the magazines on automatic
 rifles can be used on squad machine guns, while the drums of squad
 machine guns can be installed on precision rifles. The Chinese Army is equipped with numerous models of heavy firepower
 weapons, in addition to independently developed high-performance rifles. Among them, the most interesting ones are the 99A main battle tank,
 ZTZ-96B tank, Type 15 new light tank, long-range box rocket, PHL-191
 long-range rocket and PHL-03 long-range rocket and many kinds of
 modernized infantry fighting vehicles, which are mainly equipped in our
 army. The 99A main battle tank is China's first tank with a level of
 protection of 1,000mm of homogeneous steel armor or more, and is a
 third-generation variant of the Type 99 tank capable of reducing the
 penetration ability of armor-piercing rounds through the different
 properties of a variety of materials. As for the air force, the PLA Air Force units are currently equipped
 with J-20 stealth fighters, J-16 and Su-35 fighters. Straight-20 helicopters are installed in the force, and auxiliary models
 such as J-20, Yun-20, Air Marshal-500, and Red-9B are constantly being
 unveiled. UAVs with multiple functions are even more numerous (UAV
 technology is a global leader). The J-20, which is currently in service
 mainly with the Chinese Air Force, is currently China's most powerful
 5th generation aircraft in terms of overall combat capability, and also
 has the function of commanding unmanned wingmen, which is only available
 in 6th generation aircraft. With the support of the J-20 series, the
 Chinese Air Force's strategic early warning, air strike, air defense and
 anti-missile defense, information countermeasures, airborne operations,
 strategic delivery and integrated security capabilities have been
 greatly enhanced. In addition, we have the advanced Red Flag-17A close-range air defense
 missile system for air defense operations. In order to cope with modern
 warfare, the PLA forces are also equipped with ground-based unmanned
 combat platforms, which can be used in conjunction with the brand-new
 FK3000 air defense system for mobile all-weather air defense operations. In combat, we can intercept all types of drones, roving missiles and
 other low, slow and small targets with the help of technology, as well
 as cruise missiles, armed helicopters and other targets. On the naval front, China now has three aircraft carriers, a number of
 destroyers, frigates and nuclear submarines, especially the Type 055
 destroyer and the Type 094 nuclear submarine. The Type 075 amphibious
 assault ship with a full load displacement of 40,000 tons has a maximum
 range of 8,000 nautical miles, and is uniquely designed with strong
 maneuverability. Full load displacement of 37,000 tons of type 901
 ocean-going supply ship is also essential to support the modern combat
 “big killers”. It is a new type of comprehensive supply ship
 independently developed by China, which can provide sea supply for the
 naval carrier formation and far-sea maneuvering formation. In addition,
 China also has the Dongfeng-41 and other intercontinental ballistic
 missiles and Jurong-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, these
 weapons make China has the ability to long-range strikes, once India
 comes to offend, we can be the first time to end their “backyard”! India's weapons and equipment because of their own R & D capability is
 poor, basically rely on imports, and China with a lot of money to
 research and development of weapons is different, most of the Indian
 army's military expenditures are used in the import of weapons and
 equipment. This is the Indian army's equipment in the overall
 presentation of the “universal made” characteristics. Army, the Indian army is mainly equipped with 32 models of rifles,
 machine guns, sub-machine guns, including Franchi SPAS-15, SAF Carbine
 2A1 sub-machine guns, miniature Uzi sub-machine guns and other models of
 firearms. Nearly 30 of these are dependent on imports. The Indian Army
 is also equipped with T-90 series tanks, Arjun tanks, T-72 tanks, BMP2
 Infantry Fighting Vehicles, K9 self-propelled artillery guns, Tornado
 long-range rockets, Pinaka rockets, M777 howitzers, and a wide range of
 artillery systems. This is their heavy artillery unit. The T-90 series of tanks mainly used by the Indian heavy firepower units
 were purchased from Russia with a few modifications. This model of tanks
 using smoothbore technology and new composite armor structure, although
 can enhance the combat effectiveness of Indian heavy artillery units to
 a certain extent, but more than 600 mm of armor thickness also makes its
 action slow, if in the Indian mainland plains for combat, the advantages
 of this weaponry can not be fully played out. Air Force, the Indian Air Force is mainly equipped with models: Rafale,
 Su-30MKI, Mig-29, Mirage-2000, LCA Glory, Jaguar, Mig-21, etc. , there
 are some naval carrier-based models, the most advanced for the Apache. The Indian Rafale belongs to the 3rd. 5 generation twin-engine medium
 fighter, which is the strongest French fighter in service, and its
 performance is roughly similar to that of the European Typhoon, American
 F-18E/F, Russian Su-35, and Chinese J-10C. Currently, the Indian Air Force (IAF) is widely equipped with the
 Su-30MKI, a 3rd generation twin-engine, heavy, long-range multi-role
 fighter that India purchased from Russia. Mainly against the U. S. F-15E,
 Russia Su-30SM, China J-16 and other models. The Indian Air Force (IAF)
 is equipped with the MiG-29 which is even more outdated in comparison,
 being a 3rd generation frontline medium fighter developed by the Soviet
 Union. The Mirage-2000 model is a French-made 3rd generation light
 fighter. On the naval front, most of the Indian Navy equipment is also purchased. The Indian Navy currently uses ships such as the Vikramaditya aircraft
 carrier, Kolkata class destroyers, Delhi class destroyers, Shivalik
 class frigates, and other multi-functional ships. The carrier
 Vikramaditya, which is currently the Indian Navy's most powerful
 combatant, was converted from the Soviet Union's Kiev-class IV and was
 officially commissioned in 2013, carrying 24 MiG-29Ks. The Calcutta-class destroyer equipped by the Indian Navy is India's
 first self-made shield ship, with combat power at the level of European
 entry-level shield ships. Delhi-class destroyer is India's first
 self-developed destroyer, comprehensive combat effectiveness and China
 052B similar, full load displacement of 7500 tons. Indian Navy currently
 has 2 nuclear submarines are also in serious injury paralyzed state,
 these nuclear submarines are in the case of not in service on the
 serious injury, until now has not been repaired, about the same as India
 has no nuclear submarines.
