In Maoming, Guangdong, as you drive up the winding mountain roads of
 Genzi Town, you are surrounded by lush lychee trees. Known as the
 "Living Lychee Museum," the Genzi Gongyuan (Gong Garden) is hidden
 amidst this verdant paradise. Upon entering the garden, you will see towering ancient trees with
 sturdy trunks, their shapes uniquely shaped by the passage of time. There are winding paths through the grove where visitors can stroll and
 take photos while enjoying the view. "The garden has 95 ancient trees
 over 100 years old, with an average tree age of over 370 years. Among
 them, 30 trees are over 500 years old, and 9 trees are more than 1000
 years old. each one is a treasure! " said Zhang Yi, Chief Engineer of
 the Gaozhou Forestry Bureau. The practice of treating ancient lychee trees as treasures has deep
 roots in Maoming. The city has a history of over 2200 years of lychee
 cultivation, and there are around 1000 lychee trees that are more than
 500 years old, with the oldest tree reaching over 1900 years. In recent
 years, the protection of ancient lychee trees has benefited from new
 technological approaches, more public involvement, and a more
 comprehensive system. Through scientific surveys, a total of 2023
 ancient lychee trees in Gaozhou have been registered and archived, with
 26 ancient lychee tree clusters designated for protection. Among them,
 the ancient tree cluster in Genzi Town was selected as one of the "Top
 100 Most Beautiful Ancient Tree Clusters" nationwide. Local efforts
 focus on overall protection, with measures based on the age of the trees
 and the level of protection they require. In Genzi Gongyuan, each ancient lychee tree over 100 years old is given
 an "ID card. " By scanning the QR code, information such as species, tree
 age, management units, and caretakers is readily available. Beneath the
 tree canopy, the Maoming Lychee Industry Big Data Platform, utilizing
 Guangdong Mobile's "5G+IoT," collects data on soil, climate, and pest
 conditions, which is reported in real time. After expert analysis,
 scientific guidance is provided to assist the caretakers in maintaining
 and protecting the trees, controlling pests, and applying fertilizers
 and pesticides correctly. In 2022, the Gaozhou government invested 35 million yuan to transfer the
 protection of these ancient trees to Guangdong Guoxiang Group Co. , Ltd. for unified management. "The city has established an expert database
 with 27 specialists. For key protected ancient lychee trees, we provide
 on-site diagnosis and treatment advice based on 'one tree, one plan. '
 Additionally, there is a team of 16 experienced lychee farmers, known as
 the 'Ancient Tree Guardians,' who are responsible for the long-term
 maintenance and recovery efforts of the ancient lychee trees," said Deng
 Yuhua, the management head of Genzi Gongyuan. He pointed to He Shuzhi,
 an experienced lychee grower from Baqiao Village in Genzi Town, "He is
 one of the 'Ancient Tree Guardians. '"
 
 Once, during a routine inspection of the garden, He Shuzhi discovered an
 issue with one of his "responsible trees"â€”a 1300-year-old Bai Tang Ying
 lychee tree. The tree's core had a patch of white powder at its base. Based on his years of experience with lychee cultivation, He suspected a
 pest infestation, though he wasn't sure of the cause. He immediately
 reported the situation. After an expert consultation, it was confirmed
 that termites were the culprit. The issue was quickly addressed with
 professional termite control measures, and the ancient tree was restored
 to health. "Since the completion of the ancient tree registration and archiving in
 2018, no ancient tree has died from pests, diseases, or human damage in
 Gaozhou," said Zhang Yi. Despite their ancient age, these trees produce an abundant harvest each
 year, with some yielding 300-400 jin (Chinese pounds) and others
 reaching 700-800 jin, all exceptionally sweet. In the local "lychee
 customization" model, these ancient trees are especially prized. The towering, lush ancient trees not only beautify the rural landscape
 and evoke a sense of nostalgia but also harbor new "wealth codes. "
 Currently, Gaozhou has developed five small parks featuring ancient
 lychee trees and more than 20 tourist spots centered around these trees. The "Sweet Fruit Sea" rural tourism demonstration belt, with its scenic
 avenues and the Genzi River Greenway as the main axis, connects these
 cultural and tourist spots in a string, attracting over 2 million
 visitors annually. The integration of "culture + lychees" and "tourism +
 lychees" is gradually forming a model for development. On February 28th, 2023, the Ministry of Public Security announced that
 to support the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic
 Belt, a special operation titled "Safe Yangtze" would be launched
 nationwide. This initiative, effective from March 1st, 2023, aims to
 crack down on significant illegal activities in the Yangtze River's
 waterway, particularly related to fishing, sand mining, and water
 transport logistics. The operation targets the illegal activities
 affecting the security of the economy, public safety, and ecological
 stability of the Yangtze River. In 2023, law enforcement agencies handled over 6,500 criminal cases
 involving the Yangtze River, apprehending more than 11,000 suspects and
 dismantling 815 criminal gangs. They also focused on cleaning up 5,100
 key water areas. This operation has effectively maintained the economic,
 public, and ecological security of the river. The Ministry highlighted the enforcement efforts against illegal fishing
 activities, particularly gang-driven or chain-linked crimes, and has
 continuously strengthened the crackdown. Notably, in August and
 September 2023, the Ministry coordinated with local agencies to carry
 out a major regional strike against illegal fishing in the Hunan, Hubei,
 Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, significantly reducing criminal cases
 related to illegal fishing. In addition, the Ministry launched a
 two-month special operation to address the illegal capture and sale of
 precious and endangered species like the Yangtze sturgeon. This
 operation led to the disruption of illegal networks involved in these
 activities, with 81 cases broken. Regarding illegal sand mining along the river, law enforcement focused
 on all aspects of the illegal process, including mining, transport, and
 sale. In 2023, 232 criminal cases involving illegal sand mining were
 solved, with 110 criminal gangs dismantled and a total amount of 250
 million yuan seized. The continuous efforts from multiple law
 enforcement agencies have led to the successful investigation of
 large-scale organized crimes and significantly deterred illegal sand
 mining activities. In response to the United States' threat to seize control of Greenland,
 the Danish government announced on the 27th that it will strengthen its
 military presence in the Arctic and North Atlantic regions. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a press conference
 held in Copenhagen that Denmark will invest 14. 6 billion Danish kroner
 (about 2 billion USD) into a new military defense plan for the Arctic
 and North Atlantic regions, including Greenland. Specific plans include
 the procurement of three new Arctic naval vessels, the addition of two
 long-range drones, and the upgrade of satellite monitoring systems to
 strengthen intelligence surveillance of Greenland and its surrounding
 areas. Additionally, the plan will involve increasing the number of
 personnel for military training on Greenland. Poulsen emphasized, "We must face the fact that the Arctic and North
 Atlantic are facing severe challenges in terms of security and defense. "
 He mentioned that all political parties in Denmark have reached a
 consensus on this plan. This current plan is just the beginning, and
 political parties will work towards further strengthening deterrence and
 defense capabilities in these regions later this year. EU High
 Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell,
 expressed support for Denmark and its autonomous territory of Greenland,
 stating that the EU is not currently negotiating on the issue of
 Greenland. Greenland, located in the northeastern part of North America, is the
 world's largest island. It is an autonomous territory of Denmark with
 extensive self-government, but its defense and foreign affairs are
 handled by the Danish government. The island is rich in resources such
 as rare earth elements. Since the November 2024 U. S. presidential
 election, the victorious Trump has repeatedly expressed a strong desire
 to take control of Greenland. In the early morning, military wife Cao Xue walked out of Ali Airport
 with the crowd and boarded a car specially arranged for her. She still
 had more than 400 kilometers to go. Just before the Spring Festival, Cao
 Xue departed from Yili, Xinjiang, took a train to Kashgar, and then flew
 to Ali. From the airport, it would take another day to reach her
 husband, Yuan Le, at the Saren Border Defense Company. In the evening, Cao Xue saw her husband's figure appear in her line of
 sight, and her eyes immediately filled with tears. Yuan Le, feeling
 guilty yet concerned, asked, "Do you have altitude sickness? You must be
 tired from the journey. " Military wives, like migratory birds, travel
 to border areas and coastal defense posts, overcoming harsh weather and
 challenging road conditions, just to reunite with their husbands
 stationed at the borders. Together, they measure the land their husbands
 are determined to protect with their own steps, feeling the warmth of
 home and the love for the country. With the New Year approaching, Cao Xue and the soldiers were busy making
 dumplings, pasting Spring Festival couplets, and hanging lanterns,
 decorating the barracks to make it festive and warm, bringing a sense of
 comfort. The ability of soldiers to remain focused on their posts is
 inseparable from the tolerance, understanding, and selfless dedication
 of each family member. It is a vivid reflection of the saying, "You
 guard the country, and I guard you. "
