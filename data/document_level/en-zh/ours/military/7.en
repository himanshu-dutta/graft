Israeli Military Conducts Intensive Operations in the West Bank: Will
 the Situation Escalate Further? As the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip takes
 effect, the fighting in Gaza has temporarily subsided. However, tensions
 in the West Bank have continued to rise in recent days. The Israeli
 military has been carrying out intensive military operations in the West
 Bank, raising concerns about whether the situation will escalate
 further. Increased Violence in the West Bank: A Continuation of the
 Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
 
 Qin Tian, Deputy Director of the Middle East Studies Institute at the
 China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, noted that
 violent activities in the West Bank have significantly increased
 recently. This is a continuation of the ongoing rise in violence in the
 region since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict began, or rather, an
 escalation and intensification of that violence. In the West Bank, there are two types of violent activities:
 
 1. Clashes between Palestinian and Israeli armed forces or militant
 groups: Against the backdrop of Israel's 15-month-long large-scale
 military operations in Gaza, anti-Israeli forces among Palestinians in
 the West Bank have been growing. This phenomenon has prompted the
 Israeli military to take strong repressive actions in the West Bank. 2. Civilian conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians: Some Israeli
 extremists have been expanding Jewish settlements on Palestinian land in
 the West Bank. This expansion infringes on Palestinian land, including
 their homes, living spaces, and resources. With the support of the
 Israeli military, these settlers hold a more dominant position and often
 engage in aggressive actions against Palestinians. These two types of conflicts have deep historical roots. If the
 conflicts continue, they could lead to new flashpoints and casualties in
 the West Bank. UN: Annexation of the West Bank Violates International Law
 
 On the 20th, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres warned that any
 partial or complete annexation of the West Bank by Israel would
 constitute a serious violation of international law. He called on the
 international community to work together to prevent the situation from
 deteriorating. Israel's Attempt to Annex the West Bank Through "Gradual Encroachment"
 
 Qin Tian explained that Israel's open rhetoric and plans to annex the
 West Bank are gradually being put into practice. This is evident in
 three ways:
 
 1. On the ground realities: Palestinian land in the West Bank is being
 gradually encroached upon by Israeli settlers. This weakens the
 prospects for Palestinian statehood, and given Palestine's vulnerable
 position, it is difficult for them to prevent these realities on the
 ground. 2. Israel's domestic political shift to the right: The growing influence
 of far-right factions in Israel, who advocate for expanding settlements
 and annexing more Palestinian land, has made the annexation of the West
 Bank part of the government's agenda. 3. U. S. support: With backing from the United States, Israel is further
 considering annexing the West Bank, increasing the likelihood of new
 conflicts between Israel and Palestine over the West Bank issue in the
 future. Israeli Forces Withdraw from West Bank Refugee Camp After Deadly Raid
 
 On Tuesday, July 4, Israeli forces withdrew from a refugee camp in the
 West Bank following a large-scale military operation that began on
 Monday targeting Palestinian armed groups. Over a thousand Israeli
 soldiers participated in the raid, which resulted in the deaths of at
 least 12 Palestinians. Israel claimed that all those killed were
 combatants, though militant groups have so far acknowledged only five of
 their members as fatalities: four from Islamic Jihad and one from Hamas. Shortly after midnight on Tuesday, Israel reported that one of its
 soldiers had also been killed. As residents who had fled the fighting began to return after the Israeli
 withdrawal, explosions and gunfire were heard near Jenin Hospital. During the retreat, Israel stated that it had conducted an airstrike on
 militants in a cemetery, but there was no indication of Israeli military
 presence near the hospital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at a nearby military
 checkpoint, said, "At this moment, we are completing the mission, and I
 can say that our extensive operation in Jenin is not a one-time event. "
 
 The Israeli military reported that it had detained 120 suspected
 militants in Jenin and seized weapons and explosives during the
 operation. Palestinian health officials confirmed 12 deaths and 100 injuries, with
 20 of the wounded in critical condition. The Palestinian Red Crescent stated that it had evacuated approximately
 3,000 of the 17,000 residents in the camp since the Israeli operation
 began on Monday. Some Jenin residents sought shelter in schools and
 other public buildings, while many others stayed indoors to avoid
 clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters in the
 streets. The Israeli military operation included drone strikes, bulldozers, and
 hundreds of soldiers. Authorities described the mission as a
 counterterrorism effort. The violence was condemned by Palestinians, neighboring Jordan and
 Egypt, and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas, declared, "Our Palestinian people will not surrender,
 will not raise the white flag, and will continue to resist this brutal
 invasion with determination. "
 
 Also on Tuesday, Israeli authorities reported that eight Israelis were
 injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, raising
 concerns that the military assault on the Jenin refugee camp in the
 occupied West Bank could trigger further violence. In Washington, the U. S. State Department said on Monday that it was
 closely monitoring the conflict and emphasized that "all possible
 measures must be taken to prevent civilian casualties. " The State
 Department added that the fighting underscores the need for Israeli and
 Palestinian security forces to work together to restore calm. The Jenin raid comes as Israel's right-wing government, formed in
 December, faces increasing pressure to respond firmly to a series of
 attacks against Israelis in the region, including an incident last month
 that left four dead. Jenin has been a hotspot for Israeli-Palestinian
 violence since the spring of 2022. Lynn Hastings, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian
 Territories, expressed on Twitter that she was "shocked by the scale of
 the Israeli military operation. " She added that the UN is mobilizing
 humanitarian assistance. Last week, the UN Security Council urged all parties to exercise
 restraint and called on Israelis and Palestinians to "refrain from
 unilateral actions that could further escalate tensions. "
 
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Indian Foreign Minister
 Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on July 25, on the sidelines of the ASEAN
 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Laos, and both sides agreed to resolve the
 border disputes as soon as possible. In mid-July, Reuters cited informed government officials as saying that
 India is considering speeding up the visa process for Chinese
 technicians. Industries in India, such as telecommunications, steel and
 solar panels, require Chinese technicians to operate equipment made in
 China. These changes reflect that both sides have realized the urgency of
 further improving mutual trust. With a combined population of over 2. 7 billion people, China and India
 are the world's most populous countries and two of the fastest-growing
 major economies. The changing relationship is important to global
 geopolitics. The China-India relationship is a delicate dance of cooperation and
 competition. Both countries recognize the benefits of economic
 cooperation and have made significant strides in recent years to
 strengthen trade and investment ties. China is India's largest trading partner, and China's exports to India
 have increased significantly in recent years. However, despite the growing economic interdependence, the relationship
 is also marked by intense competition and strategic rivalry. The biggest obstacle to deepen cooperation between China and India is
 the trust deficit that has developed over the years. The two countries have a long history of border disputes, which has left
 a deep scar on the relationship. The Doklam standoff has only
 exacerbated the mistrust. Besides, China's growing presence in the Indian Ocean and its increasing
 influence in India's neighborhood have raised concerns in New Delhi
 about Beijing's intentions. India is in a challenging position. India wants to benefit from China's economic growth and investment. It
 also needs to expand imports of intermediate goods, raw materials and
 machinery and equipment to ensure its expanding exports. However, India has also been placing more restrictions on Chinese
 investment due to its own national sentiments and misgivings about
 China's strategic objectives and impact on national security. At the same time, India also harbors considerations of replacing China
 in manufacturing, although it is unlikely that this will happen in the
 foreseeable future. India's participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the
 US, Japan and Australia is an indication of its interest in balancing
 China's influence in the region. What can be done to improve the relationship between China and India? First, we need to build trust by resolving border disputes and
 establishing clear communication channels to prevent misjudgments. Second, we need to strengthen economic cooperation by signing more trade
 and investment agreements and promoting people-to-people exchanges. Finally, we must work together on global issues such as climate change,
 counter-terrorism and non-proliferation to demonstrate our commitment to
 multilateralism and global governance. While the challenges are significant, the benefits of a stronger
 relationship are undeniable. In the strategic positioning of the development of both sides, it is
 necessary to clearly recognize that they should not be overly influenced
 by the US' strategic approach toward China. Instead of putting too much
 emphasis on each other's strategic competitiveness, it is important to
 weaken the hostile emotions between the two countries and make decisions
 more independently in the current geopolitical environment. This will
 help drive substantial progress in the relationship between the two
 countries. As the two countries continue to grow and evolve, it is essential that
 they work together to build trust, strengthen cooperation and promote
 peace and stability in the region.
