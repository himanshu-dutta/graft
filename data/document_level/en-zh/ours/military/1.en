 raising their phones to take photos. This laptop, launched by Lenovo
 Group, features a frameless screen and a transparent keyboard area,
 offering a minimalist and futuristic design. The product utilizes
 artificial intelligence technology to combine physical objects with
 digital information, opening new avenues for work collaboration and
 efficiency improvement: when a sunflower is placed behind the screen,
 the user can trace the shape of the flower on the screen, and the camera
 will recognize the object in front, displaying text on the right side of
 the screen to explain the planting methods, plant characteristics, etc. "This is a major development direction for personal computers in the
 future, and it's impressive," said Ivan Lusardo, a contributor to a
 technology media outlet in Colombia. "Chinese products have greatly
 enriched the user experience. "
 
 At the Honor booth, the eye-tracking car control technology got many
 testers eager to try it out: by opening the phone's interface, simply
 focusing on one of the four options—"Start, Move Forward, Move Backward,
 Turn Off"—the paired car would respond to the command. James Brighton, a
 British automotive engineer, said that the future applications for
 eye-tracking car control technology will be vast. It is a
 forward-thinking technology that could enable convenient operations in
 complex scenarios, enhancing work efficiency. As a company deeply engaged in artificial intelligence voice technology,
 iFlytek's translation devices have greatly facilitated many visitors. At
 the counter, any visitor could rent a translation machine for free,
 equipped with features like voice translation, photo translation, and
 offline translation, helping people from various countries communicate
 with each other during the event. Waldir from Brazil rented the device for two days and was impressed by
 its functions and technology. "I only speak Portuguese, and I am often
 limited in communication. With the help of this translation device, I
 can more smoothly connect with exhibitors from all over the world. "
 
 "Chinese companies have formed outstanding overall strength. "
 
 Network technology iteration is one of the core technical elements
 focused on at the World Mobile Communication Conference. By the end of
 2023, more than 300 5G commercial networks were established globally,
 with over 1. 6 billion 5G users. During the conference, the 5G-A
 technology, evolved from 5G, attracted significant attention. On February 26, Huawei released its self-developed large model for the
 telecommunications industry at the conference. According to the
 introduction, the large model uses advanced technologies and algorithms
 to provide key intelligent capabilities aimed at optimizing
 communication network performance and intelligent resource scheduling. It aims to achieve the intelligent objectives of the 5G-A era, evolved
 from 5G technology. This model offers two types of application
 capabilities: intelligent language interaction abilities to enhance
 employees' knowledge and work efficiency, and intelligent agent
 applications for various operational scenarios, analyzing and breaking
 down complex processes, orchestrating operational plans to ensure user
 experience and satisfaction. A Huawei technical expert gave an example,
 stating that network issues that used to take ordinary users hours or
 even days to resolve could now be solved in just 20 to 30 minutes using
 the large model. Additionally, Huawei, in collaboration with its partners, has built
 Europe's first 5G-A 10G outdoor network in Barcelona. This allows people
 to enjoy a fast internet experience while basking in the sunlight
 outdoors, such as watching high-definition videos anytime and anywhere. Zhao Dong, Vice President of Huawei's Wireless Network Product Line and
 Chief Marketing Officer, believes that 5G-A will further open up larger
 market spaces in sectors like consumer internet, industrial internet,
 the Internet of Vehicles, and the low-altitude economy, driving the
 digital transformation and upgrade of various industries and society as
 a whole. In response to the increasingly urgent green development tasks, the
 telecommunications industry's innovative technologies and products in
 sustainable development are gaining attention. In the German town of
 Kiel-Torf, ZTE Corporation has employed solar energy, methanol hydrogen
 fuel cells, and smart energy storage technologies to assist in building
 communication stations, solving problems related to high network costs
 and poor stability in remote areas. In Ghana, traditional fuel-powered
 large iron tower base stations are both energy-consuming and expensive. Chinese tech companies like Huawei have proposed innovative solutions,
 replacing the original large base stations with small iron poles powered
 by solar panels. This solution has increased the country's network
 coverage from 80% to over 90%. During the exhibition, the World Internet Conference hosted a special
 forum titled "Computing Power Networks: Intelligent Networks Empowering
 a Smart World," focusing on jointly accelerating digital transformation
 and ensuring that digital technologies better benefit humanity. John
 Hoffman, CEO of the Global System for Mobile Communications Association
 (GSMA), emphasized that digital transformation is reshaping every aspect
 of life, and with the emergence of new technologies and services, an
 increasing amount of data needs to be processed. He stated, "In the
 deployment and service of computing power networks, Chinese operators
 are already in a leading position. "
 
 Wang Xiang, Senior Vice President of ZTE Corporation, summarized the
 characteristics of new network technologies as "faster, more efficient,
 and greener. " He pointed out that China has been increasing its
 investments in the development of new infrastructure in recent years,
 promoting the coordinated development of communications and computing
 power. "Chinese companies have formed a remarkable overall strength
 around core network businesses and upstream and downstream industries. "
 
 "Chinese companies have made important contributions to deepening
 digital field cooperation. "
