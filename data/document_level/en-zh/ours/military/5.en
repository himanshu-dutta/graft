U. S. Unmanned Fleet Plan May Face Major Adjustments: No Longer Pursuing
 Large Platforms, Ensuring Mass and Rapid Construction
 
 After years of intermittent testing, the U. S. Navy's unmanned fleet plan
 may undergo significant adjustments. According to a report by "The
 Drive" on the 17th, Rear Admiral William Daly, Director of Surface
 Warfare Requirements for the U. S. Navy, revealed at the annual symposium
 of the Surface Navy Association that the Navy needs to simplify the
 design of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to ensure they can be built in
 large quantities and quickly. This approach aims to meet future demands
 and address the ongoing shrinkage of the U. S. Navy's fleet size. Developing a Universal Unmanned Surface Vessel
 
 The report states that Daly's focus is on guiding the Navy's investments
 in future surface warfare capabilities, including high-profile projects
 such as medium and large unmanned surface vessels. During his public
 speech at the symposium held in the suburbs of Washington, D. C. , Daly
 emphasized, "The current focus is on accelerating the pace of operations
 and simplifying the categories of unmanned surface vessels. Unlike
 previous statements, we are no longer pursuing the distinction between
 large and medium unmanned surface vessels. More directly, the future
 hybrid fleet of the U. S. Navy does not need large or overly
 sophisticated unmanned platforms. We must be more pragmatic. "
 
 According to the U. S. Navy's original plan, the future fleet would be
 equipped with two main types of unmanned surface vessels: large and
 medium. In the fiscal year 2025 budget request, the Navy defined large
 unmanned surface vessels as being 300 feet long, with a displacement of
 2,000 tons, capable of carrying anti-surface warfare payloads and
 equipped with a 32-cell vertical launch system. Medium unmanned surface
 vessels, on the other hand, would be 200 feet long, with a displacement
 of less than 500 tons, and would focus more on intelligence gathering
 and reconnaissance. According to a report by the Congressional Budget
 Office on January 6, titled "Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2025
 Shipbuilding Plan," the Navy plans to steadily purchase two large
 unmanned surface vessels per year for most of the next 30 years, while
 also advancing the procurement of other unmanned surface vessels and
 underwater drones. The ultimate goal is to "equip 134 unmanned vessels. "
 
 However, under Daly's new vision, the Navy will blur the distinction
 between large and medium unmanned surface vessels and instead develop a
 universal unmanned surface vessel capable of performing both
 intelligence gathering and combat missions. The reason for this shift is
 that "large unmanned surface vessels have become overly sophisticated,
 expensive, and difficult to accept. I am skeptical about their ability
 to join the fleet. "
 
 Daly explained that the universal unmanned surface vessel he envisions
 would be sized between the current large and medium vessels and could
 accommodate up to four 40-foot standard containers for different mission
 payloads, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, air defense,
 and anti-ship warfare. The U. S. Navy has already equipped unmanned
 surface vessels with various containerized mission payloads, the most
 notable of which is the four-cell Mk 70 launcher. This system is a
 technical continuation of the widely used Mk 41 vertical launch system
 and can launch multi-purpose Standard-6 missiles and Tomahawk cruise
 missiles. It can be easily installed on the deck of surface vessels
 without requiring extensive modifications. According to Daly's vision,
 these containers with different payloads would look identical from the
 outside, making it difficult for adversaries to determine the specific
 mission of the unmanned vessel through reconnaissance. "This approach
 can confuse the enemy. What's inside the container? Weapons or different
 payloads? Let them guess," Daly said. Additionally, Daly expects that the payloads carried by future unmanned
 surface vessels will become even more diverse, including laser weapons,
 high-power microwave devices, and even electronic warfare systems. Controversies Surrounding Unmanned Surface Vessels
 
 Daly's dissatisfaction with the Navy's unmanned fleet plan is largely
 due to its slow progress. "The Drive" noted that since fiscal year 2021,
 Congress has allocated approximately $500 million for the development of
 medium and large unmanned surface vessels. Currently, the Navy has only
 two medium unmanned surface vessels, the "Sea Hunter" and the "Sea
 Hawk," which are primarily used as technology testbeds for unmanned
 operations. Meanwhile, after the Navy took over the Pentagon's "Ghost
 Fleet Overlord Program" in 2022, it acquired four large unmanned surface
 vessels: the "Ranger," "Nomad," "Mariner," and "Vanguard. " However,
 these vessels are still in the testing phase and have not yet been fully
 integrated into the fleet. The challenges faced by the U. S. Navy's unmanned fleet plan highlight
 the complexities of transitioning to a more automated and cost-effective
 naval force. As the Navy seeks to balance innovation with practicality,
 the coming years will be critical in determining the success of its
 unmanned vessel initiatives.
