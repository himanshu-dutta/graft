General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized that “Implementation must be
 the primary approach in carrying out work—thinking critically, finding
 solutions, and putting forward genuine and effective measures to ensure
 that every task in the Party Central Committee’s decisions and
 deployments is properly executed. ” He further stated, “We must adhere to
 a pragmatic and results-oriented approach, ensuring that all work is
 carried out in a solid and effective manner. ”
 
 The Opinions of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee on
 Consolidating and Expanding the Achievements of Thematic Education on
 Studying and Implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
 Characteristics for a New Era stress the importance of integrating
 learning, thinking, and application while maintaining unity between
 knowledge, belief, and action. It calls for rectifying work attitudes,
 strengthening motivation, fostering synergy, facing challenges head-on,
 and demonstrating the courage to struggle. The goal is to energize
 officials with a strong entrepreneurial spirit, establish a solid
 framework for implementation, and mobilize immense strength to
 comprehensively advance the building of a strong nation and the great
 rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese modernization. At the Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year, it
 was emphasized that implementation must be carried out without deviation
 to ensure the final outcomes align with the intentions of the Party
 Central Committee. Implementation should be swift and decisive,
 balancing timing, intensity, and effectiveness. It must be pragmatic and
 results-driven, with a firm stance against formalism and bureaucratism. Furthermore, implementation should be bold and proactive, ensuring the
 right selection and appointment of personnel while fully leveraging the
 enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of leading cadres at all levels. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's
 Republic of China and is a critical year for achieving the goals and
 tasks outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Planning accounts for 10%,
 while execution determines 90% of success. In recent weeks, our
 reporters have visited grassroots officials to observe their efforts in
 strengthening Party building at the grassroots level, promoting
 high-quality development, and advancing comprehensive rural
 revitalization. Through their steadfast commitment to implementing the
 Party Central Committee’s decisions step by step and taking solid,
 practical actions, they are demonstrating vibrant real-world practices. In Dadian Town, Junan County, Linyi City, Shandong Province, the
 high-standard farmland of Zhongxin Village is already showing lush green
 winter wheat. Many farmers have begun spring field management. “This is
 the first wheat crop planted after the farmland was built, so I had to
 come and take a look,” said Chen Liming, Party Secretary of Dadian Town. Agriculture is Dadian Town's primary industry. Last year, the town used
 68 million yuan in government funds to plan and build 21,000 mu (about
 1,400 hectares) of high-standard farmland. But how can good policies be
 effectively implemented and turned into real, tangible results? “No
 matter how good the plan is, what truly matters is its execution on the
 ground,” Chen Liming emphasized. Dadian Town has been strengthening
 grassroots Party organizations, with Party members and officials
 dedicated to ensuring thorough implementation. In 2023, Dadian Town conducted 15 training sessions on Party-related
 business at the town level, targeting government agencies, “two new”
 organizations (non-public and social organizations), and rural areas. To
 enhance governance, the town established a "Five-Mechanism & One
 Assessment" system, which includes village cadre role pledges, clear job
 responsibilities, democratic evaluations, organizational interviews,
 suspension training, and comprehensive performance assessments. Cadres
 unable to fulfill their roles were promptly replaced, ensuring a strong
 and effective team of village officials. At the initial planning stage of the high-standard farmland project,
 village Party secretaries led village committee members into the fields
 to explain the project details and gather farmers’ feedback. “If we
 don’t visit the fields, it’s all just empty talk—what matters is whether
 farmers truly benefit and whether the project meets the right
 standards,” said Chen Liming. Before construction officially began, each
 village held public meetings to review and refine the plans. Issues such
 as road placement, irrigation channel layout, and irrigation
 infrastructure design were carefully discussed and optimized based on
 local needs. During construction, the town assigned daily on-site supervisors to
 ensure smooth execution. “To understand the progress and address
 villagers' concerns, I need to see things for myself,” said Chen Liming. Earlier, Chen Liming discovered a cement road section that did not meet
 the required thickness standard. He immediately ordered it to be
 re-paved to meet specifications. “Implementation means strict adherence
 to standards—no cutting corners, no compromises! ” he stressed. As the wheat entered the green-up stage, Chen Liming visited Xu Bing,
 the head of a local cooperative, asking about any difficulties. “We hope
 to receive more professional technical guidance on agricultural
 techniques,” Xu Bing replied. Chen Liming promptly arranged for experts from Linyi Science and
 Technology Vocational College to provide on-site technical guidance. “We’ll make sure every farmer understands the techniques clearly,” he
 assured reporters. “In the new year, we will meticulously implement policies and work
 diligently. With practical actions, Dadian Town will undoubtedly
 continue to thrive,” Chen Liming said with confidence. As night deepens in Taiping Road, Yunyan District, Guiyang, Guizhou
 Province, the unveiling ceremony of Guancheng River’s reopening marks a
 historic moment. As the golden curtain slowly lifts, clear waters once
 again flow, reconnecting a river that had been sealed for years. Watching the lively and bustling scene, Yang Yi, Director of the Yunyan
 District Urban Renewal Affairs Center, remarked, “This has fulfilled the
 dreams of many citizens. ”
 
 As a symbolic old town neighborhood, Taiping Road has witnessed
 Guiyang’s transformation over the years. Since 2023, Yunyan District has
 actively promoted the “One River, One Road, One Area” urban renewal
 initiative, accelerating Taiping Road’s renovation and modernization. This revitalization project includes uncovering the river, renovating
 old residential areas, upgrading commercial streets, and preserving
 historical and cultural heritage. The local government has carefully
 balanced development and conservation, exploring a new urban renewal
 path. "From planning, design, and construction to final operations, the
 timeline is tight, the process is complex, and the challenges are
 extensive. Delivering a high-quality result that satisfies residents is
 no easy task," Yang Yi acknowledged. Despite the many hurdles, he
 ensured strong execution, efficiency, and precision. “Tasks that need to
 be implemented immediately must not be delayed, while those requiring
 in-depth study should not be rushed—everything must proceed in an
 orderly manner. ”
 
 Since the renovated commercial district requires market-driven
 operations, Yang Yi hired a professional third-party firm to evaluate
 the project, conducted a nationwide search for business partners, and
 introduced advanced management models and private capital to enhance
 operations. "Sometimes, residents’ expectations don’t fully align with the project’s
 reality," Yang Yi admitted. To address this, he and his colleagues
 actively listened to community feedback, gathered opinions, and
 continuously refined the plan. “We must broaden our thinking, encourage
 collective wisdom, identify shortcomings, and make timely improvements. ”
 
 Given the involvement of multiple government departments, Yang Yi and
 his team immediately established a dedicated task force, cutting the
 construction timeline to under three months. The project is expected to
 be fully completed by May this year. "We are exploring full-cycle urban renewal strategies across the five
 key stages of investment, financing, construction, management, and
 operations. The biggest challenge right now is long-term management,"
 Yang Yi explained. His team is actively seeking professional firms to
 ensure effective and sustainable management of Taiping Road. “At the
 grassroots level, we must not only understand and analyze policies but
 also take responsibility and ensure solid execution. Only by
 implementing real, effective measures can we deliver tangible results. ”
 
 Recently, in Qingping Village, Shazhou Town, Qingchuan County, Guangyuan
 City, Sichuan Province, a village cadre annual assessment meeting took
 place. "Our ‘Baiye No. 1’ tea plants are growing in well-formed rows, and last
 year we successfully registered the trademark ‘Qingsha Xue. ’ This year,
 fresh leaf production is expected to surpass 20,000 jin," said Wang
 Yongming, Party Secretary of Qingping Village, with confidence. “The key
 now is how to integrate into the market quickly and sell at a good
 price. ”
 
 Wang elaborated on his strategy: “With the support of the county’s Party
 organization department, our village collective economic organization is
 partnering with Guangyuan Tea Industry (Group) Co. , Ltd. to leverage
 their market and sales expertise, ensuring ‘Qingsha Xue’ reaches a
 broader audience. ”
 
 A few years ago, Qingping Village identified tea cultivation as a key
 industry, planting ‘Baiye No. 1’ based on local resource conditions. However, lack of experience led to issues like albino tea not turning
 green and root rot. To resolve this, the village invited experts from
 Zhejiang to diagnose problems and develop solutions. Eventually, they
 implemented pruning, intensive harvesting, regular fertilization, and
 weed control techniques to improve tea quality. "In the past, village cadres were often burdened with excessive
 paperwork and reporting, leaving little time for hands-on industrial
 development," Wang reflected. To ease administrative burdens, Qingchuan
 County reformed its village-level inspection and assessment system. "The county’s Party organization department now directs township Party
 committees to conduct differentiated assessments based on each village’s
 unique situation, focusing on indicators like Party leadership and
 industrial growth," explained Yang Jianhua, a member of the Qingchuan
 County Party Committee and Minister of the Organization Department. By
 consolidating inspections into a single annual review, the county has
 significantly reduced the workload for village cadres. "Now, our assessment focuses on whether village cadres have truly driven
 development and how they are evaluated by the people," Wang noted. Under
 the leadership of village officials, Qingping Village produced 18,000
 jin of fresh ‘Baiye No. 1’ tea last year, generating over 20 million
 yuan in total revenue. Looking ahead, Wang is focused on ensuring better tea growth. “Right now
 is a critical period for tea plant management. We must organize
 villagers to fertilize and weed the fields to secure a good harvest for
 the upcoming spring tea season. ”
 
 "At the grassroots level, effective implementation requires
 understanding local realities, identifying key challenges, and
 maintaining a pragmatic approach," Wang emphasized. With a clear vision,
 Qingping Village remains committed to strengthening its tea industry and
 fostering long-term economic growth.
