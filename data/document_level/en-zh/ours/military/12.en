 By Guo Yuandan, Reporter for Global Times-Global Network
 
 On the morning of the 22nd, the lead ship of the People's Liberation
 Army Navy's (PLAN) 054B frigate, the Luohe (with hull number 545), was
 officially commissioned at a military port in Qingdao. Military experts
 interviewed by the Global Times stated that the 054B frigate is an
 ocean-going vessel equipped with a new power system, advanced
 performance, and the capability to undertake air defense,
 anti-submarine, and other missions. With its strong long-range and
 integrated combat capabilities, it is one of the most advanced frigates
 in the world. The Luohe has a displacement of approximately 5,000 tons and is a
 new-generation frigate independently developed and built by China. It
 has achieved breakthroughs in stealth technology, combat command
 systems, and integrated firepower control, significantly enhancing its
 overall performance. The ship boasts strong comprehensive combat
 capabilities and the ability to perform diverse military missions,
 making it a critical asset for improving the PLAN's overall combat
 effectiveness and supporting its transformation and development. Earlier, Colonel Wu Qian, Director of the Information Bureau of the
 Ministry of National Defense and spokesperson for the Ministry of
 National Defense, responded to reports about the 054B frigate's launch
 in Shanghai. He stated that the Chinese Navy's development of main
 battle ships and other equipment is part of a normal arrangement aligned
 with national security needs and the overall development of naval
 construction. Its purpose is to safeguard national sovereignty,
 security, and development interests, as well as to better maintain
 global and regional peace and stability. China has always adhered to a
 path of peaceful development and a defensive national defense policy. Military expert Zhang Junshe told the Global Times on the 22nd that the
 commissioning of the 054B lead ship marks a major breakthrough for China
 in the field of naval equipment. Its advanced radar detection and
 firepower integration technologies, powerful combat capabilities,
 particularly its strong anti-submarine capabilities and excellent
 stealth performance, will significantly enhance the PLAN's integrated
 combat capabilities. The breakthroughs of the 054B frigate are reflected in its stealth
 technology, combat command systems, and integrated firepower control. In
 terms of stealth technology, the 054B incorporates new design concepts,
 technologies, and materials to reduce its radar cross-section, enhancing
 its survivability on the battlefield. In the combat command system, the
 054B achieves more efficient and precise command and control through
 information integration and performance improvements. In terms of
 firepower integration, the ship is equipped with an advanced
 multi-functional vertical launch system capable of launching various
 types of missiles, giving it strong comprehensive combat capabilities. Military expert Zhang Xuefeng, in an interview with the Global Times on
 the 22nd, also praised the ship's stealth capabilities. "The overall
 design of the 054B frigate is very streamlined, with strong stealth
 capabilities. It uses a rotating dual-sided active phased array radar,
 which has a long detection range and strong multi-target tracking
 capabilities. Combined with improved anti-aircraft missiles, it can
 effectively counter future aerial threats. Compared to the four-sided
 active phased array radar used by large destroyers, this radar uses two
 antennas to achieve 360-degree coverage, offering better
 cost-effectiveness. "
 
 Zhang Xuefeng added that the ship's anti-submarine, anti-ship, and air
 defense capabilities are well-balanced, making it one of the most
 advanced frigates in the world. "More importantly, through the
 application of new technologies, the 054B frigate strikes an excellent
 balance between cost-effectiveness and performance. The Navy can produce
 these ships in large numbers to meet the demands of diverse maritime
 threats. "
 
 Previous analyses suggest that the 054B will play a significant role in
 aircraft carrier battle groups, particularly as a key anti-submarine
 asset. In this regard, Zhang Junshe stated that the 054B excels in
 information integration and combat command, enabling it to undertake
 medium-range air defense missions. "The ship is equipped with advanced
 active phased array radar and fire control radar, which provide
 long-range detection and wide-area coverage, allowing it to identify
 distant targets and respond quickly to air and sea threats. Additionally, its anti-submarine capabilities are particularly
 noteworthy. The enlarged helicopter deck and hangar can accommodate
 larger new anti-submarine helicopters, and it is equipped with a variety
 of sonar systems and anti-submarine weapons, giving it strong integrated
 anti-submarine capabilities. As a result, the ship can join aircraft
 carrier and amphibious assault ship formations, performing both
 medium-range air defense and underwater anti-submarine missions,
 effectively serving as a 'guardian' for aircraft carriers or large
 amphibious assault ships. "
 
 Regarding the commissioning of the Luohe at a military port in Qingdao,
 Zhang Junshe noted that this will facilitate joint training with the
 Liaoning aircraft carrier battle group, enabling early integration and
 synergy. "We also have aircraft carriers deployed in Sanya, so the 054B
 frigate will likely be deployed there in the future. "
 
 On the morning of December 27, 2024, the naming ceremony for the lead
 ship of China's independently developed Type 076 amphibious assault ship
 was held at the Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. The Type 076 is
 the world's first amphibious assault ship to feature electromagnetic
 catapult technology. Less than a month later, on January 22, 2025, the
 Luohe, the lead ship of the 054B frigate, was commissioned, marking a
 strong start to the new year. Zhang Junshe believes that this reflects the growing capabilities of
 China's defense industry, shipbuilding technology, and national
 technological development. The 054B frigate, developed over a decade of
 improvements and innovations based on the 054A, showcases China's rapid
 progress and remarkable achievements in naval equipment research,
 development, and construction, further strengthening the country's
 defense capabilities. "With the gradual commissioning of advanced ships
 like the 054B frigate, the PLAN will possess stronger long-range
 integrated combat capabilities, enabling it to better defend national
 sovereignty, security, and development interests. Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 29 â€“ U. S. Department of Defense
 spokesperson John Ullyot stated on January 28 that newly appointed
 Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the revocation of former
 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley's security detail and
 the suspension of his access to classified information. Fox News reported earlier that day, citing government officials, that in
 addition to issuing the aforementioned orders, Hegseth also directed the
 formation of a review committee to investigate Milley's alleged actions
 to "undermine the military command structure" during former President
 Donald Trump's first term. The review may lead to Milley's retirement
 rank being downgraded from four-star general to lieutenant general. In 2020, Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of Iran's
 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed in a U. S. airstrike,
 prompting Iran to vow retaliation. Following this, the U. S. government
 provided security protection for Milley and other officials. Milley served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to
 2023, spanning both the Trump and Joe Biden administrations. He
 frequently clashed with Trump, who at one point even threatened him with
 execution for "treason. "
 
 After being sworn in on January 20, Trump immediately began removing
 officials from the Biden administration. On January 21, he announced on
 his social media platform, "Truth Social," that he would "fire"
 thousands of Biden-era officials, specifically mentioning the removal of
 Milley from the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. Within two hours of Trump's inauguration, a portrait of Milley, which
 had been displayed in the Pentagon for just 10 days, was taken down. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine told the media that Trump personally
 ordered its removal. On January 20, just before leaving office, Biden announced a
 "preventive" pardon for Milley, former National Institute of Allergy and
 Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, and members of the House
 Select Committee on the January 6 Capitol riot, aiming to shield them
 from potential retribution under the new Trump administration. On February 3 (local time), two senior officials from the Palestinian
 Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) stated that Hamas is ready to begin
 negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. A Hamas official said, "Hamas informed the mediators during ongoing
 communications and meetings in Cairo last week that it is ready to start
 the second-phase negotiations. " A second official confirmed that the
 group is "waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round of
 talks. "
 
 According to the terms of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and
 Israel, the first phase of the ceasefire took effect on January 19. Both
 parties were then set to begin indirect negotiations on February 3 to
 finalize the details of the second phase.
