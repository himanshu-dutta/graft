Internal contradictions intensified, and the Chief of the General Staff
 of the Israeli army will resign. Media reports suggest Netanyahu should
 follow suit. Huang Pei Zhao, a special correspondent for the Global
 Times mission in Egypt, and Wang Yi, a special correspondent for the
 Global Times, reported heightened internal conflict within the Israeli
 government as aid supplies continue to enter Gaza. According to The Times of Israel on the 21st, in order to assume
 responsibility for the heavy losses suffered by the military during the
 "Al-Aqsa Flood" campaign launched by the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
 Movement (Hamas) on October 7, 2023, the Chief of the General Staff of
 the Israeli army, Herzi Halevi, announced his resignation on the same
 day. At the same time, the Israeli army launched another military
 operation in the Palestinian West Bank, killing and wounding dozens of
 Palestinians. There was also a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, Israel,
 which injured several people. According to The Times of Israel, Halevi stated in his resignation
 letter to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that under his command, the IDF
 "failed to fulfill its mission to protect Israeli citizens" during the
 October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, and he requested that his term end on
 March 6, 2024. [Corrected date: "March 6 this year" was incorrect. ]
 Halevi said: "The decision to resign had been made long ago. Now that
 the army has gained the upper hand in all war zones and a hostage
 exchange agreement is underway, the time has come for me to step down. "
 
 Halevi also called for the establishment of an "external committee" to
 investigate the Israeli military's failures. He stated that a "thorough,
 high-quality, and fully transparent investigation" of the IDF must be
 conducted, with findings presented to Gallant and the public. Halevi
 further emphasized that no one concealed information about the October 7
 attacks, no one "knew what was coming," and no one "aided the enemy in
 carrying out atrocities. "
 
 The Washington Post reported on October 21 that on October 7, 2023, more
 than 3,000 Hamas militants crossed into Israel, killing about 1,200
 people and taking 250 hostages. The attack sparked nationwide reflection
 in Israel, with increasing public demands for the government and
 military leaders to take responsibility. According to The Times of Israel, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel
 Smotrich, while praising Halevi's contributions, criticized him for
 failing to dismantle Hamas' political and military capabilities and not
 "taking responsibility for the failure of October 7. "
 
 Haaretz reported on the 21st that the Netanyahu government had two
 objectives in removing Halevi. First, to eliminate obstacles to passing
 a controversial draft law exempting ultra-Orthodox men from military
 service. Halevi had been a staunch opponent of the bill. Another senior
 official with similar opposition—former Defense Minister Gallant—had
 already been dismissed. Second, to shift responsibility for the major
 failure on October 7, 2023. Netanyahu has long sought to deflect blame
 for this failure, attempting to place responsibility on the military and
 intelligence agencies. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition Future Party in the Israeli
 parliament, tweeted on the 21st: "Now is the time for the Prime Minister
 and his disastrous government to take responsibility and resign. "
 Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the "Israel is Our Home" Party, made
 similar remarks. Haaretz opined that Netanyahu should follow Halevi's
 example by voluntarily stepping down and apologizing to the families of
 the victims and fallen soldiers. Analysts suggest that the next person to resign might be Ronen Bar, head
 of Israel's National Security Agency (Shin Bet), who played a
 significant role in the ceasefire agreement. According to The Washington
 Post, a former Israeli government official stated that Netanyahu and his
 allies are eager for Bar to step down after Halevi, using this
 opportunity to "clean house. " The official added that the resignation of
 the head of the security agency could have negative repercussions,
 potentially replacing professional security personnel with
 government-loyal (and less qualified) officials. Meanwhile, aid is entering the Gaza Strip at unprecedented speed and
 scale. Reuters reported on the 22nd that over 2,400 trucks carrying
 supplies entered Gaza in the first three days of the ceasefire
 agreement, with thousands more expected in the coming days. Additionally, numerous Hamas police and municipal officials have been
 engaged in distributing aid, clearing debris, and repairing
 infrastructure since the ceasefire. Hamas stated that no aid convoys in
 Gaza had been looted since the 19th. According to Reuters on the 21st, the Israeli military conducted an
 operation in the West Bank city of Jenin, killing at least 10
 Palestinians and injuring dozens more. Netanyahu described the operation
 as a "large-scale and important military action. "
 
 The Guardian reported that shortly after the operation, U. S. Permanent
 Representative to the United Nations, Stephanie B. Malick, nominated by
 Trump, expressed support during a U. S. Senate hearing for Israeli
 sovereignty over the entire West Bank. Critics argue that Malick's
 position undermines U. S. international credibility and complicates
 efforts to promote a "two-state solution. "
 
 On the same day, a stabbing attack occurred in Tel Aviv, Israel. According to The Jerusalem Post, the attacker was a Moroccan citizen
 with a U. S. green card. At least four people were injured in the attack
 before the attacker was fatally shot by an armed civilian. NATO leaders recently stated that NATO will launch an operation
 codenamed "Baltic Sentinel," aimed at preventing Russian sabotage and
 espionage activities in the Baltic Sea region and protecting the
 security of Baltic Sea undersea cables. Monitoring Russia's "Shadow Fleet"
 
 At the end of 2024, an undersea cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden
 was severed; at the same time, another communication cable linking
 Finland and Germany broke in the same waters, and an undersea cable
 between Finland and Estonia also suddenly malfunctioned. NATO suspects
 that these incidents are part of Russia's "hybrid warfare" tactics. To
 strengthen defense capabilities in the Baltic Sea region, NATO has
 decided to launch the "Baltic Sentinel" operation. Military analyst Shao Yongling stated that NATO countries believe
 Russia's "shadow fleet" was responsible for damaging the undersea cables
 in the Baltic Sea. The "Baltic Sentinel" operation aims to enhance
 surveillance and deterrence against Russia's "shadow fleet. "
 
 Shao Yongling:
 
 The so-called "shadow fleet" is actually a special fleet formed by
 Russia to circumvent Western sanctions. It consists of decommissioned or
 old oil tankers that frequently navigate the Baltic Sea, transporting
 Russian oil products abroad via Saint Petersburg. Due to the existence
 of the "shadow fleet," Western sanctions on Russia have had minimal
 impact. Now, NATO countries claim that the activities of the "shadow fleet" in
 the Baltic Sea not only pose a threat to the undersea cables but also to
 undersea natural gas pipelines. Using this as an excuse, NATO has
 intensified its monitoring and deterrence efforts against the "shadow
 fleet," employing various means of surveillance, including surface
 vessels, aerial patrols, and drones. The essence of this action is to strengthen sanctions. In addition, the UK recently teamed up with 10 Nordic countries to
 launch a system called "Nordic Watcher," which uses artificial
 intelligence data analysis technology to monitor and track entities or
 activities that may pose a potential threat to underwater
 infrastructure, while also keeping an eye on the movements of Russia's
 "shadow fleet. " However, recent reports have suggested that after
 investigating the incidents of several underwater cables being damaged
 in the Baltic Sea, three intelligence officers from the US and Europe
 stated that these events may have been accidental, rather than caused by
 "Russia's deliberate sabotage. "
 
 So why is NATO still launching these operations under the guise of
 "preventing Russian sabotage"? In response, Shao Yongling stated that
 protecting underwater cables is just an excuse for NATO's actions, and
 its true intention is to strengthen sanctions against Russia in the oil
 and gas sector. Shao Yongling:
 
 Recently, the UK and the US have introduced new sanctions against
 Russia. At the same time, the "Baltic Sentinel" operation and the
 "Nordic Sentinel System" will also be launched. The goal of all these
 actions is the same: to stop the "shadow fleet" from transporting
 Russian oil abroad. In theory, the movements of the "shadow fleet" should not be affected. However, now the West has accused it of sabotaging the underwater
 cables. This allows them to intercept and seize the "shadow fleet" under
 the pretext of protecting the cables. Therefore, I believe this is still
 a method for the West to impose economic sanctions and a blockade on
 Russia. The effectiveness remains to be seen. When discussing whether NATO's "Baltic Sentinel" and other actions can
 achieve their intended goals, Shao Yongling analyzed that while these
 actions will objectively have some impact on the operations of Russia's
 "shadow fleet," they cannot fundamentally block Russia's channels for
 exporting oil. Shao Yongling:
 
 In fact, Russia has many channels for oil exports, which reflects the
 ineffective results of Western sanctions against Russia. The next step
 is to see whether the Trump administration will introduce new sanctions
 measures. If it further intensifies sanctions on Russia, it is likely to
 refocus on the energy sector.
