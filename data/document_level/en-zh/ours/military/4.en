Over the past year, the 14th National People’s Congress (NPC) and its
 Standing Committee have diligently studied and implemented President Xi
 Jinping’s key insights on upholding and improving the people’s congress
 system. Aligning closely with the Party’s and the nation’s overall
 strategic goals, they have fulfilled their duties in accordance with the
 law, demonstrating both responsibility and initiative. As a result, the
 NPC system has made a strong start, showcasing vitality and resilience,
 while whole-process people’s democracy continues to flourish, yielding
 substantial achievements. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the NPC, a
 significant milestone. Moving forward, the NPC will refine its role in
 driving high-quality development and advancing Chinese modernization. With a steady yet progressive approach, it aims to further enhance the
 quality and effectiveness of its work, ensuring that the people’s
 congress system continues to contribute meaningfully to national
 governance and reform. The First Session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) passed
 the Decision on Amending the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of
 China. "The Legislation Law is the 'law that governs laws,' and its
 amendment and implementation are of great significance in strengthening
 the Party's comprehensive leadership over legislative work in the new
 era, ensuring the comprehensive construction of a socialist modern
 country on the rule of law," said a relevant official from the National
 Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee. Over the past year, the implementation of the Central Committee's
 decisions on legislative work has progressed steadily and rapidly. The
 14th NPC Standing Committee proposed a legislative plan and coordinated
 the legislative work of this session. Key achievements include advancing
 high-quality development by enacting laws such as the Qinghai-Tibet
 Plateau Ecological Protection Law and the Food Security Law,
 accelerating legislation in the areas of people's livelihood and social
 issues with laws such as the Barrier-Free Environment Construction Law
 and Patriotism Education Law, strengthening foreign-related legal
 frameworks with laws like the Foreign Relations Law and Foreign State
 Immunity Law, and revising the Anti-Espionage Law and the Civil
 Procedure Law regarding foreign-related matters. So far, a total of 6 laws have been enacted, 9 laws have been amended,
 and 11 decisions on major legal issues have been passed. On November 29, 2023, at the grassroots legislative contact point in the
 Xiaobailou Subdistrict of Heping District, Tianjin, the atmosphere was
 lively during a legislative consultation meeting on the draft revision
 of the Cultural Relics Protection Law. "We hope that the new revision of
 the Cultural Relics Protection Law will reflect the work on cultural
 relic restoration. " "The law should clarify and strengthen the
 accountability for damage to cultural relics. " At the meeting,
 participants from various sectors freely expressed their opinions and
 offered suggestions. The "golden ideas" from the public have been transformed into "golden
 keys" for legislation for the people, with the genuine voices of the
 people directly reaching the national legislative bodies and the solemn
 People's Great Hall. The 14th National People's Congress (NPC) and its
 Standing Committee have adhered to democratic and open legislation,
 continuously enriching and expanding the ways for the public to
 participate in the legislative process in an orderly manner, integrating
 whole-process people's democracy into the entire legislative work. Establish and make good use of grassroots legislative contact points. The Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the
 National People's Congress (NPC) has set up 45 grassroots legislative
 contact points, driving provincial and municipal-level people's
 congresses to establish over 6,500 legislative contact points. This
 further smooths the "direct channel" for grassroots and public
 participation in the legislative process, fully incorporating public
 opinion and gathering the wisdom of the people. Ensure the public solicitation of opinions on draft laws and research
 feedback. 24 draft laws were published for public consultation,
 collecting over 200,000 comments and suggestions from various sectors,
 making grassroots democracy more "perceptible" and "usable. "
 
 Improve the system and mechanism for the participation of NPC
 representatives in the legislative process. Invite NPC representatives
 to participate in legislative research and deliberations, send important
 draft laws to all representatives for their opinions, carefully study
 and incorporate their suggestions, and provide timely feedback, working
 together to address key issues in the legislation. Filled with the expectations of the people, advancing high-quality
 legislation. In its first year of service, the 14th National People's
 Congress and its Standing Committee fully promoted democracy, built
 legislative consensus, and embodied and safeguarded the fundamental
 interests of the broadest masses. They worked to ensure that every law
 reflects public opinion, addresses people's livelihoods, and aligns with
 people's will, effectively promoting development and ensuring good
 governance through sound laws. The load-bearing structure and main structure of a building are related
 to residents' living conditions and public safety. Previously, a
 property management regulation in a certain province stipulated that "if
 the owner or property user damages the load-bearing structure or main
 structure of the building, relevant departments shall order immediate
 correction and restoration to the original state, and may impose a fine
 of between 10,000 and 50,000 yuan; if the circumstances are serious, a
 fine of between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan may be imposed. " However, it was
 this provision that led to a record review by the Standing Committee of
 the National People's Congress. "According to the Regulations on the Quality Management of Construction
 Projects issued by the State Council, if building users alter the main
 structure and load-bearing structure of a building during renovations,
 they shall be ordered to make corrections and fined between 50,000 and
 100,000 yuan. " After review, the Law and Procedure Committee of the
 Standing Committee of the National People's Congress determined that the
 penalties in the local regulations were significantly lower than the
 fine range specified in the State Council's administrative regulations,
 which constituted a relaxation of control. Additionally, while the State
 Council's regulations impose fines "and may impose," the local
 regulations use "may impose," resulting in a noticeably lighter penalty
 that was inconsistent with higher-level laws and needed to be corrected. Ultimately, the local legislative body amended the relevant provisions. Conducting record review of administrative regulations, local
 regulations, judicial interpretations, and other normative documents is
 an important supervisory power granted to the Standing Committee of the
 National People's Congress by the Constitution and laws. The Standing
 Committee of the National People's Congress, in implementing the spirit
 of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, made a
 decision to improve and strengthen the record review system. They adhere
 to the principles of "every document must be submitted for record, every
 record must be reviewed, and any errors must be corrected. " In 2023,
 they received 1,319 regulatory documents, judicial interpretations, and
 other normative documents for record submission. They also studied and
 provided opinions on 2,827 review suggestions submitted by citizens and
 organizations, as well as 90 review suggestions transferred from other
 record review institutions. In all matters, the well-being of the people is paramount. The urgent
 and difficult issues that the people are most concerned about are the
 key focus of the supervision by the National People's Congress. Over the
 past year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has
 adhered to the principles of correct supervision, effective supervision,
 and lawful supervision, safeguarding the "steady happiness" of the
 people. In October 2023, the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of the 14th
 National People's Congress held a joint meeting to conduct a special
 inquiry on the reports regarding the work of the State Council on
 combating crimes in the field of ecological environment and resource
 protection, the work of the Supreme People's Court on environmental and
 resource trials, and the work of the Supreme People's Procuratorate on
 ecological environment and resource protection prosecution. This was the first time the Standing Committee of the National People's
 Congress conducted a special inquiry on three reports from the "One
 Government, Two Courts" system surrounding the same theme. The inquiry
 ensured that questions were answered, effectively examining the
 implementation of the Party Central Committee's decisions and policies,
 as well as the legal situation in the field of ecological environment
 and resource protection. It focused on addressing law enforcement and
 judicial issues that concern the public, promoting the law enforcement
 and judicial bodies to fulfill their duties in accordance with the law,
 improving mechanisms, strengthening coordination, and gathering
 collective strength to build a beautiful China. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, over the past
 year, integrated support into its supervision efforts, adopting multiple
 measures and making continuous progress. It conducted enforcement
 inspections of the Seed Law to support the revitalization of the seed
 industry. It also heard and reviewed reports on the situation regarding
 domestic violence prevention, reform of the examination and enrollment
 system, and mental health work, all aimed at improving people's
 well-being. Additionally, it inspected the implementation of 5 laws,
 heard and reviewed 22 work reports, conducted 2 special inquiries, and
 carried out 7 special investigations. These actions effectively
 addressed prominent issues that concern the public and significantly
 contributed to high-quality economic and social development.
