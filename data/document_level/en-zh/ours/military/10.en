What role will the Luòhé frigate play in the aircraft carrier fleet in
 the future? This morning (22nd), the Luòhé frigate was officially commissioned at a
 naval port in Qingdao. The naval frigate Luòhé, bearing the hull number
 545, is a new-generation frigate independently developed and built by
 China. It represents an important asset for the modernization and
 transformation of the Navy. Experts note that the weapon system of the
 054B frigate has undergone significant upgrades. What specific
 improvements have been made to the weapon system? Watch the video below
 to hear expert insights. Military expert Cao Weidong explained that the 054B frigate’s weapon
 system has primarily increased its launch cells. As a frigate, the
 weapons and equipment it typically carries are relatively limited. By
 expanding its payload capacity, the ship can now carry longer-range
 anti-ship missiles. The 054B frigate clearly demonstrates enhanced
 capabilities in this regard. In terms of power systems, the 054B frigate adopts full-electric
 propulsion and a combined diesel-gas turbine system. This allows for
 improved sonar systems, including the ship’s bow sonar, towed sonar, and
 side-scan sonar, significantly boosting its anti-submarine warfare
 capabilities. Additionally, the 054B frigate incorporates an integrated mast. Alongside the phased-array radar, it appears to include an X-band radar,
 likely enhancing its ability to detect drones or low-altitude targets. This marks a significant upgrade in the frigate's weapon systems for
 future combat scenarios. The Role of the 054B Frigate in Aircraft Carrier Formations. The first ship of the Navy’s 054B frigate class, the Luòhé, entered
 service today. What will its primary missions be in the future, and what
 role will it play in aircraft carrier formations? Military expert Cao Weidong stated that as the 054B frigate evolves into
 a multi-purpose stealth frigate, it appears to feature modular
 functionality, allowing it to swap modules to enhance specific
 capabilities, such as anti-submarine warfare or air defense. Since the 054B is a multi-purpose frigate, it can independently carry
 out missions such as close-in reconnaissance, land-based surveillance,
 or precision strikes. It is also capable of conducting rescue and
 disaster relief operations on its own. When operating as part of an aircraft carrier formation, its upgraded
 power system, improved noise reduction, and enhanced anti-submarine
 capabilities make it particularly effective in anti-submarine roles
 within the formation. In the future, whether the Navy operates
 independently or alongside large surface vessels like aircraft carriers,
 the 054B frigate will play an even more critical role. The Evolution of the Frigate Platform: From 525 to 545
 
 The Luòhé, commissioned this morning, is the lead ship of the Type 054B
 frigate class, with hull number 545. Twenty years ago, in February 2005, the People’s Navy introduced its
 first-generation stealth frigate with ocean-going combat capabilities,
 the Type 054 frigate. The lead ship of this class, the Ma’anshan, was
 assigned hull number 525. Another ship of this class, the Wenzhou, was
 designated hull number 526. These ships laid the foundation for the development of the Type 054A
 frigate, which featured a completely new weapon system. The Type 054A missile frigate, designed and built independently by
 China, is capable of engaging surface ships and submarines either
 independently or in coordination with other naval forces. It boasts
 robust long-range early-warning capabilities, as well as regional air
 defense and missile defense capabilities. The lead ship of the Type 054A class, the Xuzhou (hull number 530),
 joined the Navy in January 2008. It was equipped with advanced anti-air,
 anti-missile, and anti-submarine weapons, as well as a Z-9C
 anti-submarine helicopter, enabling it to perform air defense, missile
 defense, and surface strike missions. Over the past two decades, from hull number 525 to 545, the Type 054
 frigate platform has undergone three major technological iterations,
 reflecting continuous advancements in capability and design. Germany's government has announced that the country set a new record for
 arms exports in 2024, exceeding $13 billion, with the majority of this
 going to Ukraine. According to data reported by the German news agency
 dpa on January 21, the German government approved arms exports worth
 €13. 33 billion (approximately $13. 8 billion) last year, with €8. 15
 billion directed to Ukraine. Other major recipients of German weapons exports include Singapore
 (€1. 21 billion), Algeria (€560 million), the United States (€320
 million), and Turkey (€230 million). The release of this data was
 requested by Sevim Dağdelen, a member of the left-wing political
 alliance in the German parliament. Dağdelen criticized the German
 government for fueling global conflicts by exporting weaponry. Since the escalation of the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, Germany has
 become one of Ukraine's leading military aid providers, second only to
 the United States. As of the end of December 2024, reports indicated
 that Germany had provided Ukraine with approximately €28 billion in
 military assistance. According to Xinhua News Agency in Doha on January 21, Qatar's Foreign
 Ministry spokesperson Ansari stated that the second batch of prisoner
 exchanges following the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will proceed as
 scheduled this weekend. Relevant parties are closely coordinating to
 finalize the list of individuals and the final details. During a regular press briefing, Ansari expressed optimism about the
 coordination progress, saying, "We believe the upcoming prisoner
 exchange will go more smoothly. "
 
 Regarding the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, Ansari
 mentioned that Qatar has observed positive developments on the ground,
 including the entry of over 900 trucks carrying aid into Gaza, and the
 successful completion of the first batch of prisoner exchanges. The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic
 Resistance Movement (Hamas) went into effect at 11:15 AM local time on
 the 19th. That evening, three Israelis detained in Gaza were released
 and arrived in Israel. On the 20th, Israel's Prison Service announced
 that 90 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons had been released. According to a report by the Daily Mail on the 19th, the leadership of
 the Royal Navy plans to shorten the training time for new recruits in
 the Royal Marine Commandos by 8 weeks and eliminate some courses in
 order to save on training costs. However, British defense officials are
 concerned that this move may result in recruits lacking essential
 physical fitness and basic skills, and they may still receive a
 "graduation certificate" even if they fail to meet the "graduation
 standards. "
 
 According to reports, the Royal Navy plans to reduce the training course
 for new Royal Marine recruits starting in May this year, eliminating
 adventurous training such as rock climbing, which was originally
 designed to weed out physically weaker recruits, as well as the 4-week
 basic training. In recent decades, the Royal Marine recruit training
 course has lasted 36 weeks, 10 weeks longer than the Army. Senior
 figures in the Royal Navy have stated that this approach is reasonable,
 as Marine recruits need to undergo higher standards of training. It is
 reported that the training cost for each Royal Marine recruit is
 £120,000. The report states that due to a shortage of defense funding, the Royal
 Marines' training strategy is shifting towards that of the Army. According to sources, by shortening the training time, each new recruit
 will save £28,000, and the Royal Navy will be able to save approximately
 £2 million over five years. It is also suggested that the training
 courses for Royal Marine officers could undergo changes. One Royal
 Marine officer added, "This will be a disaster. The training course is
 long because it is necessary. "
 
 The report states that the UK Ministry of Defence has repeatedly called
 for defense spending to be increased to 2. 5% of GDP, but Prime Minister
 Starmer has refused to guarantee the achievement of this target. The
 Daily Mail previously revealed that since the Labour Party came to
 power, the UK defense budget has been significantly reduced. Notably,
 due to the donation of ammunition and stockpiled weapons to Ukraine, the
 frequency of live-fire exercises for the British military has also
 significantly decreased. UK defense officials have even considered
 reclaiming £13 million in pensions from retirees. On the evening of the
 18th, the Royal Navy stated that no final decision had been made
 regarding any training course modification plans and added, "The
 standards of the Royal Marines will not change; training will always
 remain one of the most demanding in the world. "
 
 The Russian Ministry of Defense announced on social media on the 18th
 that the Russian military used precision weapons to launch a cluster
 strike on Ukrainian military-industrial complex facilities, hitting all
 targets. The statement said that this strike was in response to an
 earlier attack by the Ukrainian military using U. S. -made Army Tactical
 Missile Systems on civilian infrastructure in Russia's Belgorod region. The targets included Ukraine's "Ray" Design Bureau, which designs and
 manufactures the "Neptune" missile system and "Tornado" multiple launch
 rocket systems. On the same day, the Ukrainian Air Force stated that Kyiv, the capital
 of Ukraine, was hit by missile strikes in the morning. Ukrainian air
 defense forces intercepted two "Iskander" missiles in the airspace
 around Kyiv. An "industrial enterprise production building" in Kyiv was
 damaged in the attack. It was reported that the building hit was located
 near the "Ray" Design Bureau and the missile and precision-guided
 weapons manufacturing company "Artem. "
