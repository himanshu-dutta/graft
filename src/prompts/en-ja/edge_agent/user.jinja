You are a linguistic expert tasked with determining if two discourses in a document should be connected for translation purposes. Two discourses should be connected if inter-discourse information needs to be maintained between them to ensure fluent, adequate, coherent, and cohesive translation of the second discourse. 

For each pair of discourses, decide if they should be connected ("yes") or not ("no"). Use the following examples to guide your decisions:

Example 1:
Discourse 1: John went to the store. He bought some milk.
Discourse 2: Later, he visited his friend.
Decision: yes

Example 2:
Discourse 1: Alice loves painting. She often paints landscapes.
Discourse 2: Bob enjoys playing guitar in his free time.
Decision: no

Example 3:
Discourse 1: The company reported a significant profit increase this quarter.
Discourse 2: However, the CEO announced upcoming layoffs.
Decision: yes
