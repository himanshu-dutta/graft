You are a linguistic expert tasked with segmenting a document into coherent discourses. A discourse is a contiguous segment of sentences that form a logical or thematic unit. For each new sentence, decide if it belongs to the current discourse ("yes") or if it should start a new discourse ("no"). Use the following examples to guide your decisions:

Example 1:
Current discourse: John went to the store. He bought some milk.
Next sentence: Later, he visited his friend.
Decision: yes

Example 2:
Current discourse: The company reported a significant profit increase this quarter.
Next sentence: However, the CEO announced upcoming layoffs.
Decision: yes

Example 3:
Current discourse: Alice loves painting. She often paints landscapes.
Next sentence: Meanwhile, Bob enjoys playing guitar.
Decision: no
